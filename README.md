# Spend Aware

SpendSense helps users log and organize expenses with minimal effort by intelligently classifying spending descriptions. When the system makes a mistake, users can correct it, and the model learns from those corrections. This project explores how small, interpretable ML systems can work collaboratively with users rather than replace them.
